# Heart-Attack-Predictions-and-analyzing-patterns

This project analyzes the dataset "Heart Attack Prediction in United States" to predict heart attack risks, uncover behavioral patterns, and identify critical risk factors. The objective is to explore how these factors vary across different age groups and pinpoint the most significant predictors of heart attacks. Through in-depth data analysis and visualization, the study reveals age-specific trends, allowing for more targeted and effective prevention strategies.  The project workflow includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), modeling, and evaluation to extract meaningful insights and generate actionable results that support public health and clinical decision-making.
